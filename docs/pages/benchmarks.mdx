# Benchmarks

Measured on Apple M2, median of 1000 iterations. Take these with a grain of salt — different machines, different compilers, different results.

## Signing

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Sign order | ~34.5 µs |
| Sign cancel | ~34.1 µs |
| EIP-712 struct hash | ~250 ns |

## Binary Size

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| `hlz` (ReleaseSmall, stripped) | 636 KB |
| `hlz-terminal` (ReleaseSmall, stripped) | 768 KB |
| SDK only (no HTTP/TLS) | 116 KB |

## Build Time

Clean build takes ~3 seconds on Apple M2. Zig's compilation model helps here.

## Reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlz/hlz
cd hlz
zig build bench
```
